# Javascript Feed Proxy
This Js demo application connects to a feed connector and receives feed messages from it. Each feed message is printed out to a new line.

You can start processing the feed by modifiying the `processMessage` function.

# Getting Started
- Run the feed connector app on your local machine
- Point HOST and PORT in app.js to the feed connector url (Defaults to localhost:8992).
- Run app.js with `node app.js`
